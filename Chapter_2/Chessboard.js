/*
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newlinecharacters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a spaceor a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a bindingsize= 8and change the program so that it works for anysize, outputting a gridof the given width and height.
